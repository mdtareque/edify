Mini Courses portal aka "edify" has been hosted on Pythonanywhere.com.

Users are categoried as "admin", "student" and "faculty".

"admin" user inherits the roles of a student i.e I have assumed that admin can be a student or a ta but not faculty.

There are seperate user interfaces for student and faculty.
